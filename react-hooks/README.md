# React Hooks

## About
This sample is a demonstration of how a developer can utilize React hooks to mimic creating a Redux-like middleware for state management.

Articles and tutorials discussing how to utilize hooks are abundant, however the article this sample was derived from does a good job at re-imagining how hook implementation can be put to more effective use.

The app is built from the ground up to try and afford the greatest freedom in development while also not over-complicating the code.
